            <h5>OUR THEOLOGY</h5>
            <p>The Anglican Church of the Messiah wholeheartedly believes and confesses Jesus Christ to be the way, the Truth, and the Life. No one comes to the Father, but by Him. </p>
            <ul>
              <li><h5>We confess:</h5></li>
              <li> The canonical books of the Old and New Testaments to be the inspired Word of God, containing all things necessary for salvation. and to be the final authority and unchangeable standard for Christian faith and life</li>
              <li>  The Baptism and the Supper of the Lord to be Sacraments ordained by Christ Himself in the Gospel, and thus to be ministered with unfailing use of His words of institution and of the elements ordained by Him;</li>
              <li>  The godly historic Episcopate as an inherent part of the apostolic faith and practice, and therefore as integral to the fullness and unity of the Body of Christ:</li>
              <li>  The historic faith of the undivided church as declared in the three Catholic Creeds: the Apostles', the Nicene, and the Athanasian.</li>
            </ul><br>
            
            <ul>
              <li><h5> We affirm:</h5></li>
              <li> The teaching of the first four Councils and the Christological clarifications of the fifth, sixth and seventh Councils, in so far as they are agreeable to the Holy Scriptures.</li>
            </ul><br>
                
            <ul>
              <li><h5> We receive:</h5></li>
              <li> The Book of Common Prayer as set forth by the Church of England in 1662, together with the Ordinal attached to the same, as a standard for Anglican doctrine and discipline, and, with the Books which preceded it, as the standard for the Anglican tradition of worship: The Thirty-Nine Articles of Religion of 1562, taken in their literal and grammatical sense, as expressing the Anglican response to certain doctrinal issues controverted at that time, and as expressing the fundamental principles of authentic Anglican belief</li>
